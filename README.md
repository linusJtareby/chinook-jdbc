### Chinook database handler

## Requirements

This application requires you to have a local connection to the Chinook database.
This is achieved with local environment variables, which are:
db_user     - your postgres username
db_pw       - your user password
chinook_db  - your database connection url

These need to be accessible on the system where this application is run.
